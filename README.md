The Hand Gesture Recognition System is a computer vision–based project designed to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time.
It uses image processing and machine learning techniques to recognize different gestures captured through a webcam or camera module.
This system can be used for human-computer interaction, contactless control, and assistive technology applications.
